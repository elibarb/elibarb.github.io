Our group of rag tag rock and rollers had just found out some terrible news. Unfortunately because it was a dream I don’t quite remember what that news was, but we were mad and it was terrible and there in front of us were the people responsible. They were another rock band that was popular, but couldn’t rock their way out of a wet paper sack. We rushed towards them as if we were going to jump them, but we knew what we had to do. Just when we were nose to nose with them I darted for my electric, the other members picked up their instruments, just in time for the lead singer to begin to wail on the microphone. The Rock and roll flew forth and in a short time we’d had our revenge. Oddly enough as I began to play I was thinking hmm this is weird because I can’t play guitar so even though the rock was coming out I was thinking how the heck do I do this. And one may ask who was this legendary band that you were playing with? None other than the group Murder by Death.</p><p>Funny dream eh?</p></article></main><div class="absolute bottom-0 w-full"><footer class="w-full h-24 text-center text-xs text-gray-400 bg-black relative"><div class="w-full px-6 md:pt-0 md:mx-auto md:max-w-5xl flex flex-1 space-between items-center absolute-center"><a href=https://travelingbeard.com/ class=absolute><div class="w-8 h-8 relative font-bold bg-white blend-diff"><h1 class="absolute-center m-0 font-charter text-2xl text-gray-100 blend-diff select-none">T</h1></div></a><div class="h-full flex-1"><span class=select-none><a href=https://github.com/negrel/hugo-theme-pico class="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-200 no-underline">Pico</a>
