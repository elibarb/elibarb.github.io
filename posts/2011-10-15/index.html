At the show I met a couple of people who of all things are friends with Joe Copeland. As we talked a bit more we found out that each of us had been at the same show back in 2006 at Remingtons in Springfield which was the first time I’d ever even heard of them let alone seen them. MM has been playing smaller venues this tour so it was cool getting to be so close. It’s cool that they have fans that have been with them since before they were MM I mean I’m one of them, but I really wish fans would stop bringing it up at shows like it is some sort of badge of honor to yell out the old band name. The guys take it pretty good, but you can tell their inner reaction is like “Really…really?” And who can blame them for wanting to get some distance from an old project that they moved on from years ago and hope that people would recognize them for what they’re working on now. I can imagine it’s tough enough to make any band endeavor successful, but it’s got to be extra challenging if your fans keep you stuck in the past. I wonder what is the best way to interact with a band member when you run into them in real life outside of a show without bothering them that still lets them know that you appreciate their music? Do you just say hey when walking past? Is a high five or shaking their hand appropriate? Do you even call them by their name or is a hey dude or hey man more appropriate and less like a creepy stalker or teenie bopper? Thoughts anyone?</p><p>My pictures aren’t the greatest, but here they are none the less for your enjoyment.</p><p>[pictures]</p><p>Along with a compilation video from the night.</p><p>[video]</p><p>[video]</p></article></main><div class="absolute bottom-0 w-full"><footer class="w-full h-24 text-center text-xs text-gray-400 bg-black relative"><div class="w-full px-6 md:pt-0 md:mx-auto md:max-w-5xl flex flex-1 space-between items-center absolute-center"><a href=https://travelingbeard.com/ class=absolute><div class="w-8 h-8 relative font-bold bg-white blend-diff"><h1 class="absolute-center m-0 font-charter text-2xl text-gray-100 blend-diff select-none">T</h1></div></a><div class="h-full flex-1"><span class=select-none><a href=https://github.com/negrel/hugo-theme-pico class="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-200 no-underline">Pico</a>
