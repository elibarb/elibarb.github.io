Play Angry Birds, maybe watch a movie, go grab a bite to eat, or check your Facebook and update twitter? Well today my status updates/check-ins would have been something like this.</p><p>Checking in at E1
B14? – Bingo there’s a Starbucks
B5 was before B9
K4 Kato, watch out for Inspector Clouseau
G14; my first co-conspirator, that dude was rad
H1=Coolest peeps in Chicago
F9…disappeared, there’s not a Starbucks here.</p><p>What you say?</p><p>That I visited and took a picture at every single Starbucks in the O’Hare airport. BTW 5 of 15 is the official statistic which indicates that amazingly 1 out of 3 Starbucks employees are willing to be good sports and get their picture taken with a random bearded stranger in the Airport. Thanks to the few that were a part of my lunacy; you guys made my day! It would have been 16 total, but F9 is a dirty liar(there’s no Starbucks there). So here’s the photographic chronicles of my adventure w/ Starbucks in the O’Hare Airport. How many can you get your photo taken by during your next visit to the airport?</p><p>….maybe this’ll be the next planking ;)</p><p>[pictures]</p><p>–edit–
Crapola, I found only too late there was an international wing with Terminal M. I have no idea how I missed it. I literally walked the entire length of the airport more than once.</p><p>[picture of terminal]</p></article></main><div class="absolute bottom-0 w-full"><footer class="w-full h-24 text-center text-xs text-gray-400 bg-black relative"><div class="w-full px-6 md:pt-0 md:mx-auto md:max-w-5xl flex flex-1 space-between items-center absolute-center"><a href=https://travelingbeard.com/ class=absolute><div class="w-8 h-8 relative font-bold bg-white blend-diff"><h1 class="absolute-center m-0 font-charter text-2xl text-gray-100 blend-diff select-none">T</h1></div></a><div class="h-full flex-1"><span class=select-none><a href=https://github.com/negrel/hugo-theme-pico class="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-200 no-underline">Pico</a>
