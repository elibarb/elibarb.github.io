	<p>The one scripture that keeps coming to mind while I’ve been traveling has been in Job 38 where the Lord answers Job.</p>
<p>1.The the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,
2.Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
3.Gird up now your loins like a man, and I will demand of you, and you declare to Me.
4.Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Declare to Me, if you have and know understanding.
5.Who determined the measures of the earth, if you know? Or who stretched the measuring line upon it.?
6.Upon what were the foundations of if fastened, or who laid its cornerstone,
7.When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
8.Or who shut up the sea with doors when it broke forth and issued out of the womb? –
9. When I made the clouds the garment of it, and thick darknetss a swaddling band for it,
10.And marked for it My appointed boundary and set bars and doors,
11.And said, Thus far shall you come and no farther; and here shall your proud waves be stayed?
12.Have you commanded the morning since your days began and caused the dawn to know its place,
13.So that light may get hold of the corners of the earth and shake the wickedness of night out of t?
14.It is changed like clay into which a seal is pressed and things stand out like a many-colored garment.
15.From the wicked their light is withheld and their uplifted arm is broken.
16.Have you explored the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?
17.Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of deep darkness?
18.Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell me if you know it all?
19.Where is the way where light dwells? And as for darkness, where is its abode,
20.That you may conduct it to its home, and may know the paths to its house?
21.You must know, since you were born then! Or because you are so extremely old!
22.Have you entered into the treasuries of snow, or have you seen the treasuries of the hail,
23.Which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?
24.By what way is the light distributed, or the east wind spread ofver the earth?
25.Who has prepared a channel for the torrents of rain, or a path for the thunderbolt,
26.To cause it to rain on the uninhabited land and on the desert where no man lives,
27.To satisfy the waste and desolate ground and to cause the tender grass to spring forth?
28.Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
29. Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who has give it birth?
30.The waters are congealed like stone and the face of the deep is frozen.
31.Can you bind the chains of the stars Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion?
32.Can you lead forth the signs of the zodiac in their season? Or can you guide the stars of the Bear with her young?
33. Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rulle upon the earth?
34.Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that an abbundance of waters may cover you?
35.Can you send lightnings, that they may go and say to you, Here we are?
36.Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the mind?
37.Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the waters of the heavens
38.When heat has caused the dust to run into a mass and the clods to cleave fast together?
39.Can you Job hunt the prey for the lion? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions
40.When they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in their hiding place?
41.Who provides for the raven its prey when the young ones cry to God and wander about for lack of food?</p>
<p>It seems to ring out in my ears, affirming his greatness and might. His immense power and wisdom. When looking at the highest mountains or facing the sea with its mighty waves, it is his hand that has wrought these things and set them in place. He has set the boundaries of the earth and it is by his word that he sustains all of creation. Great in power and might, strong in mercy and loving kindness. In comparison to him my knowledge and understanding are completely inadequate. So how then can I question his ways and designs? What about the situations that he allows or brings into my life, even the difficult ones in which I’m besieged by troubles of all kinds? What shall I say to him then? In the early part of the book Job states it well;</p>
<p>Job 2:10 – Shall we accept only good at the hand of God and shall we not accept also misfortune and what is of bad nature? –</p>
<p>What do I know or understand of these things and how can I in of myself divine their purpose. For his eyes are cast across the ages and the days of man are but few. But even in trouble I may have peace still because of his great care and love for us.</p>
<p>Matthew 10:29-31 – Are not two little sparrows sold for a penny? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground without our Father’s leave and notice. But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not then; you are of more value than many sparrows.-</p>
<p>If he knows the number of hairs on my head, in my case beard also, should I doubt the plans which he has laid.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 29:11 – For I know the plans that I have made for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, to give you hope –</p>
<p>Job 13:15 – Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.</p>
