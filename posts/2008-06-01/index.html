	<p>Thankfully I just got back my visa for India Friday. They were extremely quick to approve my application and send everything back including my passport, which they had to stamp, so the quick turn around was really relieving.  I’m still waiting on my camera to show up after I sent it in a month ago to get repaired, but as of yet no word.  Needless to say I’m not a fan of Kodak’s support structure to fix a camera that’s less than a month old.  Other then that I’ve got just about everything else that I’ll need for the trip. This week I’ll load up the back pack and tie up any loose ends in preparation for the trip. I finished the book Worldwalk that a friend had recommended about another world traveler who was the first to walk all the way around the world solo back in 1984(with the exception of oceans). It took him four years and over 15,000 miles of walking, but he found as I hope to that there are good people even in the most remote places.  Such a big undertaking is truly daunting and exhilarating all at the same time and it’s easy to get overwhelmed if I think about it too much.  But I’m ready for the journey even though I’m uncertain exactly what adventures or mishaps may be before me.</p>
<p>My rough overview goes something like this. Ireland, France, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, Romania, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and India. Thinking about possibly buying a Royal Enfield Motorcycle in India and then riding back west towards Scotland and England. Somewhere in there depending what I feel like it’s possible I may try to make it to New Zealand and Australia. Everything is still very much up in the air though and much past Ireland and France my plans are really subject to change at a moments notice.</p>
