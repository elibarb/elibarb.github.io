	<p>Trust…trust…are you getting it yet? TRUST!</p>
<p>Seems like such a simple concept to continually fail to realize into practice. Mark 9:14-29 mentions a man who came to Jesus with a son that needed healing and the father says to Jesus, “But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!” Christ responds and the man responds again, “I do believe, help my unbelief.” In my life that statement is full of meaning and could look something like this. Christ, I know your Word says you will meet me when I seek you, my experience even says when I have sought you that you’ve drawn near to me and that over and over again you love to bless me in ways I would have never been able to hope for, and everyone around me says everything will all work out, but here I am still struggling in unbelief. …I do believe, help my unbelief!</p>
<p>Christ’s responses to this man causes me to reflect and I can just imagine the tone he used to answer and the sort of quizzical, but saddened expression of shock on his face. “If You can?” Then followed by a barely audible sigh with a short  pause before he softly says, “All things are possible to him who believes.” Almost as if he’s waiting for it to sink in and for us to really get it and that if we did our lives would be transformed.</p>
<p>Later after Jesus healed the man’s son his disciples questioned him privately, “Why could we not drive it [the unclean spirit] out?” I think Jesus’ response doesn’t just apply to their immediate inference to the unclean spirit in the boy, but also to the unbelieving spirit in the boy’s father. “This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer.”  We can worry and we can fret and dwell upon every potentially negative possible outcome, but our spirit of unbelief won’t come out by anything but prayer.</p>
<p>I believe Lord, help my unbelief.</p>
